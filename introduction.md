## Shauna Shipman 

-vocalist and songwriter to Yellowjackets<br/>
-surprisingly, the one with the least social media presence among the trio<br/>
-that's good because she didn't pay attention to media training and will be prone to say things that would be a PR nightmare<br/>

-shaunanat is a huge ship in the fandom but she has no clue why<br/>

-a yellowjackets casual enjoyer (1 guess on who is her fave)<br/>
